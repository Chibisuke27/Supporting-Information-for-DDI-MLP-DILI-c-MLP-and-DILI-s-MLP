# Supporting-Information-for-DDI-MLP-DILI-c-MLP-and-DILI-s-MLP
This online repository hosts the AI models, Python code and other relevant files for DDI MLP, DILI-c MLP and DILI-s MLP.

Please refer to Supporting-Information-for-DDI-MLP-DILI-c-MLP-and-DILI-s-MLP/3_Final Results/ folder to access the trained AI models (DDI MLP, DILI-c MLP and/or DILI-s MLP). There are relevant ipynb files (accessed using Jupyter Notebook) within the sub-folders that are named "Execute xx.ipynb" where xx refers to the AI model name. Please access them using Jupyter Notebook and read the descriptions (should be intuitive) within each notebook to understand the sequence and rationale of each step. The user can use these ipynb files to use the trained AI models to perform DDI or DILI-related predictions.



GitHub upload function limits each file size to <= 25 MB. Files that exceed this size limit needs to be compressed into rar files and/or split into parts using WinRar. On that note, when downloading the supporting information onto other devices, there are two (2) steps that need to be done to ensure smooth running of the project:

1) Under "Supporting-Information-for-DDI-MLP-DILI-c-MLP-and-DILI-s-MLP/1_Featurization for DDI MLP and General DILI MLP/1_2_Featurization for General DILI MLP/1_2_1_Input":
"DB_5_1_5_drugbank_all_structures.rar" files need to be extracted within the same folder to form "DB_5_1_5_drugbank_all_structures.sdf" file.

2) Under "Supporting-Information-for-DDI-MLP-DILI-c-MLP-and-DILI-s-MLP/3_Final Results/3_1_Optimized_DDI_MLP/3_1_2_Misc Input Files for DDI MLP":
"Optimized_DDI_MLP-NN_Arch_4_1024-Triple_Feat.part1.rar" and "Optimized_DDI_MLP-NN_Arch_4_1024-Triple_Feat.part2.rar" files need to be extracted within the same folder to form "Optimized_DDI_MLP-NN_Arch_4_1024-Triple_Feat.h5" file.
